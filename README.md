PortalRemakeÂ² DESIGN

You need Node.js and NPM.

Use `npm install` to fetch the shit you need.

Use `npm run build` to build a build into dist.

This isn't a perfect project. Please build and improve on it.

An example of an improvement is to make the index.html copy into the dist folder so it can be used to host the design.
